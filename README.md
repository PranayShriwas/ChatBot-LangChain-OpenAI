# Continuous Prompt Refinement for Chatbot

# Introduction
This Python script demonstrates how to continuously refine the prompt for a chatbot based on user feedback. It utilizes the LangChain-OpenAI library to interact with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for natural language processing.

# Features
- Prompt Refinement: The script defines a function to refine the chatbot prompt based on user feedback.
- Continuous Feedback Loop: It continuously prompts the user for feedback and updates the chatbot's prompt accordingly.
- Real-time Interaction: Users can engage in a conversation with the chatbot, providing feedback as they interact.

# Usage
1. Initialization:
    - Import necessary modules from the LangChain-OpenAI library.
    - Define functions for prompt refinement and continuous refinement based on user feedback.

2. Prompt Refinement:
    - The `refine_prompt` function refines the existing prompt by appending user feedback.

3. Continuous Prompt Refinement:
    - The `continuously_refine_prompt` function continuously prompts the user for feedback and updates the chatbot's prompt.
    - It initializes the chatbot with the refined prompt and starts the conversation loop.

4. Conversation Loop:
    - The conversation loop allows users to interact with the chatbot.
    - Users can input messages, which are appended to the message list.
    - The chatbot generates responses based on the provided messages and the refined prompt.
    - The conversation continues until terminated by the user.

5. Error Handling:
    - The script handles errors such as API quota exhaustion gracefully by displaying appropriate messages and waiting before retrying.

# Example
# Your old prompt
old_prompt = "Refining and improving the prompt based on the testing, optimization."

# Start the continuous refinement of prompt based on user feedback
continuously_refine_prompt(old_prompt)

# Requirements
- LangChain-OpenAI library
- OpenAI API key

# Notes
- Users can adjust the prompt refinement function and feedback collection mechanism according to their requirements.
- It's essential to handle errors such as API quota exhaustion to ensure smooth operation.
