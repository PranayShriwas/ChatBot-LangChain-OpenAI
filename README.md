# Chatbot Integration with Error Handling

This script integrates a chatbot with LangChain OpenAI and handles errors gracefully, particularly when the API quota is exceeded. It prompts the user for input, sends it to the chatbot, and manages errors to allow for retrying after a waiting period.

# Usage:
1. Ensure that the LangChain OpenAI integration is properly set up and configured with the required API key.
2. Run the script.
3. Interact with the chatbot by entering messages in the terminal.

# Functionality:
- Initializes the chatbot with LangChain OpenAI.
- Prompts the user for input and sends it to the chatbot.
- Handles errors gracefully, particularly when the API quota is exceeded.
- Allows for retrying after a waiting period.

# Testing the Chatbot:
- After running the script, engage in conversations with the chatbot to assess its effectiveness and accuracy.
- Test various scenarios to evaluate how well the chatbot responds to different types of queries.
- Assess the chatbot's ability to understand user inputs and provide relevant and coherent responses.
- Note any areas where the chatbot may need improvement or refinement.

# Chatbot Testing Script

This script is designed for testing a chatbot implemented with the LangChain OpenAI integration. It runs a series of predefined test scenarios, sending each scenario as user input to the chatbot and printing the resulting AI responses.

# Usage:
1. Ensure that the LangChain OpenAI integration is properly configured with the required API key.
2. Run the script.
3. Observe the interactions between the user inputs and the AI responses.

# Functionality:
- Initializes the chatbot with LangChain OpenAI.
- Runs predefined test scenarios, sending each scenario as user input to the chatbot.
- Prints the user inputs and the corresponding AI responses for each scenario.

# Testing the Chatbot:
- After running the script, review the interactions between the user inputs and the AI responses.
- Evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of the chatbot's responses to each test scenario.
- Compare the expected responses with the actual responses generated by the chatbot.
- Identify any discrepancies or areas where the chatbot may need improvement.
